# Sales Data Analysis Using Pandas (Python)

## Project Description

The Sales Data Analysis project is a Python application that uses the Pandas library to analyze product sales data. The program performs structured DataFrame operations to calculate revenue, filter high-revenue records, sort results, identify maximum and minimum revenue values, update product prices, and compute category-based totals.

This project demonstrates practical business data analysis using Pandas and is suitable for beginners learning data manipulation and revenue analysis in Python.

The application executes once and displays all computed results in the terminal.

## Operations Performed

```
1. Create product sales DataFrame
2. Calculate revenue (Price × Quantity)
3. Filter records where revenue > 100000
4. Sort data by revenue (descending)
5. Identify maximum and minimum revenue
6. Filter products in Accessories category
7. Increase Electronics product prices by 10%
8. Calculate total revenue generated by Laptop products
```

## Sample Output

```
Max Revenue: 260000
Min Revenue: 30000
Total Laptop Revenue: 406000
```

---

## Edge Cases Handled

* Accurate revenue calculation using column multiplication
* Correct filtering based on revenue threshold
* Proper sorting without data loss
* Conditional price updates applied only to selected category
* Correct aggregation for specific product totals
